Java Class 1
class vs Class

Eclipse - IDE --> integrated developement environment --> helps us tp write and execute JAVA code

In Eclipse 3 main windows:
1. Project Explore --> all projects and hierarchy
2. Console --> output of the program

Below words are not same for java
javabasics
JavaBasics

Class in Java is an actual program that have .java extension.
Any executable code we must place inside main method

public static void main (String[] args) {
		
}

Inside the main method we will be writing statements. Every statement in Java MUST end with;

In our program we can add comments
// single line comment

/* multiline comment
*/

int vs println
print --> simply just prints
println --> prints and creates new line after


Keyword in Java have a special meaning! (class, static, public, void etc)

Identifiers in JAVA (giving names to your project, class, variables, methods)
RULE:
1. We cannot use keywords as identifiers
2. we cannot have space for identifiers
3. we cannot use any special characters except _ and $
4. identifier cannot start with number

Preferences:
CamelCasing:

When we want to name Class --> starts with Upper case and follows camel casing

When we want to create variables and method --> start with lower case and follow camel casing

DataTypes in Java
Primitives:
Non- primitives:

Primitives datatypes:8
Numeric values:
	whole numbers: byte, short, int, long
	decimal number (12.99): float, double
non numeric values: 
	to store single character: char
	to store boolean values (yes or no): true, false

To store these data we need a container --> variable
To store value inside the variables:
1 ) specify type

byte

2) give a name to the variable/container

byte variableName

3) assign / place the value inside the container

byte name=10;
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
main/ ctrl +space choose enter for main method
camelcase = each word starts with Upper case
-to format your code in eclipse
ctrl +shift +f 
mac = cmd +shift =f
 debug
2click on the row want to debug/ for 1st time right click on open window to debug as java app/ variables check on Window/show view/ variables/
terminate on the sqaure red button

console to open
from windows (up) / show view/ console

// multi
ctrl + A select then ctrl/

System.err.println("kfheuhf"); -->will print  red color
Syso(\n -->moves to the new line----------------);
